        <strong>Google Analytics Demographics</strong>

      <p className="sm:text-[17px] leading-loose text-sm text-balance">
        This website uses the &#34;demographic features&#34; feature of Google
        Analytics. This makes it possible to generate reports that contain
        information about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This
        data comes from interest-based advertising from Google, as well as
        third-party visitor data. This data cannot be assigned to a specific
        person. You can deactivate this function at any time via the ad settings
        in your Google account or generally prohibit the collection of your data
        by Google Analytics as described in the section &#34;Objection to data
        collection&#34;.

      <h4 className="font-semibold text-2xl mt-4">Google reCAPTCHA</h4>
      <p className="sm:text-[17px] leading-loose text-sm text-balance">
        We use &#34;Google reCAPTCHA&#34; (hereinafter referred to as &#34;reCAPTCHA&#34;) on
        our websites. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
        Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&#34;Google&#34;).
      </p>
      <p className="sm:text-[17px] leading-loose text-sm text-balance">
        The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data entry on our
        websites (e.g. in a contact form) is carried out by a human or by an
        automated program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of
        the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This
        analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the
        website. For analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP
        address, length of stay of the website visitor on the website or mouse
        movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will
        be forwarded to Google.
      </p>
      <p className="sm:text-[17px] leading-loose text-sm text-balance">
        The reCAPTCHA analyses run completely in the background. Website
        visitors are not informed that an analysis is taking place.
      </p>
      <p className="sm:text-[17px] leading-loose text-sm text-balance">
        Data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The
        website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its web
        offerings from abusive automated spying and from SPAM.
